##Overview

Manages certificates using OpenSSL.

##Module Description

The `openssl` module adds a type that generates an RSA keypair and a
self-signed X.509 certificate using OpenSSL.

##Setup

The best way to install this module is by executing the following command on
your puppet master or local Puppet install:

    $ puppet module install [--modulepath <path>] rlenglet/openssl

The above command also includes the optional argument to specify your puppet
master's `modulepath` as the location to install the module.

###What openssl affects

* RSA keypairs in `/etc/ssl/private`.
* X.509 certificates in `/etc/ssl`.

###Beginning with openssl

Specify a resource of type `openssl::self_signed_certificate` to generate an
RSA keypair and self-signed X.509 certificate files of the same name.

For instance, a resource names `apache` creates files named
`/etc/ssl/private/apache.key` and `/etc/ssl/apache.pem`:

    openssl::self_signed_certificate { apache:
      key_bits => 2048,
      cert_days => 1095,
      cert_country => US,
      cert_state => California,
      cert_organization => Foobar,
      cert_common_names => ["www.foobar.com", "webmail.foobar.com"],
      cert_email_address => "admin@foobar.com",
    }

##Usage

###Defined Type: `openssl::self_signed_certificate`

####Parameters

#####`key_path`
The path of the key file. In not specified, defaults to
/etc/ssl/private/${name}.key

#####`key_bits`

The number of bits of the RSA public key to generate.  If not specified,
defaults to `1024`.

#####`key_owner`

The user to whom the keypair file should belong.  Argument can be a user name
or a user ID.  If not specified, defaults to `root`.

#####`key_group`

The group to whom the keypair file should belong.  Argument can be a group
name or a group ID.  If not specified, defaults to `root`.

#####`key_mode`

The desired permissions mode for the keypair file, in symbolic or numeric
notation.  If not specified, defaults to `0600`.

#####`cert_path`

The path of the cert file. If not specified, defaults to /etc/ssl/${name}.pem

#####`cert_days`

The validity period of the X.509 certificate, in days.  If not specified,
defaults to `365`.

#####`cert_country`

The country code part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
Optional.

#####`cert_state`

The state / province part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
Optional.

#####`cert_locality`

The locality part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.  Optional.

#####`cert_organization`

The organization part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
Optional.

#####`cert_common_names`

The list of common names in the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
Optional.

#####`cert_email_address`

The X.509 certificate's contact email address.  Optional.

##Limitations

The keypair file is created in `/etc/ssl/private`, and the certificate
is created in `/etc/ssl`, which are the standard directories on
Debian/Ubuntu.  The files are named after the resource:
`/etc/ssl/private/<name>.key` and `/etc/ssl/<name>.pem`.  Certificate
files are owned by `root:root`, and have permissions `0644`.

The generated keypair and certificate files are not protected: if any
parameter is changed, they are re-generated.
